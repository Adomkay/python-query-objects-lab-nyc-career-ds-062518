    "In this lab we practiced using class methods and class variables to both store our class's instance objects and operate on them in order to provide answers to our questions about the fleet. We might have noticed that the Driver class is getting pretty inflated with these querying methods. Perhaps there is a way we can structure our code to make this a bit cleaner for us? Maybe we could have another class that has these query methods that we use in our other classes? Let's find out!"
